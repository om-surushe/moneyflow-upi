# nutriscan

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Here are the resources I used to build this app:

[Take a picture using the camera](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/plugins/picture-using-camera)

[Google's ML Kit Text Recognition for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_text_recognition)
